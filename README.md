# FOOD FACTS

# Abstract
At an era where more and more ecological questions are risen, it seems that European countries, such as Switzerland or France, are trying to encourage the sale of their national products within their own territory and reduce the importation of alimentary goods. Indeed, one can easily notice that swiss supermarkets are promoting regional products, with labels such as “Aus der Region”, whereas our French neighbors are developing new advertisement campaigns with labels, such as “Nos regions ont du talent” or “Reflets de France” in order to answer a growing request from customers to buy local products. However, are these few changes a simple superficial trend, or do we really import less goods? The research thus intends to determine the origin of most products we consume within Europe and beyond and understand the amount of exchanges of resources that is globally practiced, from the origin of the ingredients, the place of manufacture and the countries a product is sold in. The research will be conducted with the help of the data base Open Food Facts https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data, which provides origin information about products that are consumed in different countries around the world.
