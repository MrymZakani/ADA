    <h1>A brief introduction</h1>

    <p>At an era where more and more ecological questions have risen, it seems that European countries, such as
        Switzerland,
        are trying to encourage the sale of their national products within their own territory and reduce the
        importation of alimentary goods.
        Indeed, one can easily notice that swiss supermarkets are promoting regional products, with labels such as “Aus
        der Region” in order
        to answer a growing request from customers to buy local products. </br>

        <img class="img_intro" src="img/intro_suissegarantie.jpg" alt="Suisse garantie label">
        </br>
        However, are these few changes a simple superficial trend, or do we really import fewer goods? The research
        conducted for the lecture
        Applied Data Analysis at the EPFL intends to determine the origin of most products we consume within Switzerland
        and in general,
        to give an overview of the income of resources from other countries to Switzerland, taking into account
        information as the origin
        of the ingredients and the place of manufacture.</br>
        The research was conducted with the help of the database <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data">Open
            Food Facts</a>,
        which provides origin information about products that are consumed in different countries around the world.

    <h1>What kind of products do we most consume in the European Union?</h1>

    <p>As part of our study, it is interesting to first understand the general situation in terms of food habits of the
        population.
        What kind of products do we most consume? As we will see later, the answers can have an important impact, as
        processed food is not
        always manufactured within the country it is sold, and the origin of some products has to be foreign, as not all
        vegetables and fruits can
        grow under our latitudes. However, as Switzerland is a small country and requires the ressources from other
        countries
        in order to feed its population, it is non negligible to study the behaviour of our neighboors, before focusing
        on our country.<br><br>
        --As we can see on the map, there is....

    <p>List the categories of products in European Union</p>

    <h1>What about Switzerland?</h1>

    <p>As we can see from our data set, there is an important amount of dairy products that are available in our swiss
        supermarkets (almost 350 products out of the x products
        present in the database), which are followed by plant based products and the category of meat, fish and eggs. If
        we compare these results with
        the official report <a href="https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/05_Publikationen/SES/SES_2016-93.pdf">"Statistiques
            et évaluations
            concernant l'agriculture et l'alimentation"</a> of 2016 of the Union suisse des Paysans, it seems that the
        total amount in kg of consumption
        of plant based products per inhabitant is actually greater than dairy products.

    <p>Switzerland greatly depends on other countries in order to feed its population. Because of the repartition of the
        mountains,
        the size of arable land is not big enough in order to produce and fulfill the needs of the entire population.
        The report <a href="https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/05_Publikationen/SES/SES_2016-93.pdf">"Statistiques
            et évaluations
            concernant l'agriculture et l'alimentation"</a> of 2016 of the Union suisse des Paysans shows that, from
        2010 to 2015, the indigenous
        production covered on average 60,83% of the consumption of foodstuffs. It means that at least 39,17% of the
        products we consumed in
        Switzerland in-between 2010 and 2015 were imported goods. --This is shown/ or not shown by the results provided

<p>Another way to visualize the most important manufacturers for Europe is the following network graph. Here we can
    clearly see
    that France is the biggest importer, with a total of 45826 products, whereas the rest of the importers are
    proportionaly pretty equivalent in the
    number of products they import.</p>

    <h1>Is there an evolution of importation of goods in time?</h1>

    <p>The swiss Federal Customs Administration (AFD), departement of the swiss confederation, proposes free open data
        on the swiss import of varied products. Among others, the quantity of products from Food, Beverages and Tobacco
        imported every year since
        1988 is available. We can see that there is a increase of imported foodstuffs throughout the years. In order to
        better
        understand this phenomenon, we determined a strong linear correlation between this increase and the growth of
        the swiss
        demography since 1988.

    We also studied the different flows of monthly imports on a shorter period, from 2012 to 2018, and found that
    there is a tendency to import more products during spring season. This can be due to the fact that Switzerland is
    not capable
    of producing the total amount of food consumed in the country (only about 60%) and that spring corresponds to the
    time of the year
    when the country's stockpiles are on credit. After a long winter and with the arrival of new seasonal fruits that
    are not always or already
    available in Switzerland, spring seems to be the time of the year where foreign ressources are most
    required.<br><br>

    <h1>So... are we consuming local?</h1>

    <p> In a general way, we can say that we do consume more local products than imported ones. Indeed,
        Switzerland still provides more food goods than it imports, with a mean of approximately 60%. However, we do not
        eat more local products everytime of the year. It seems that during the course of spring, or at the end of the
        winter
        Switzerland lacks of indigenous products and needs to import more foreign products.<br>
        Overall, there is also a great tendency to import more and more foodstuffs, but this can be explained by the
        fact the swiss
        population is growing. This growth of demography means that there are more and more people to feed but
        the surface of arable land cannot increase consequently. Future challenges to be considered for the coutry would
        be to still be
        able to produce the majority of products its population consumes in incoming years. Yet, this important question
        of local
        ressources also belongs to the bigger problematic of the availability of the earth's ressources, and the fact
        that we use more
        than what the planet can renew (this year, on 1st August 2018, we had consumed more than what the planet
        can provide in an entire year according to <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/">Global Foorprint Network</a>),
        but it is not
        the focus of this report.
    </p>

    <h2>Is the dataset really accurate?</h2>

    <h2>As a final word</h2>

    <p>Consumming more localy is a difficult task, as it means to be aware of the real seasons for foods such as
        vegetables or fruits,
        and to restrict our consumption of some products to specific times of the year. Indeed, the consumption of fresh
        tomatoes, strawberries
        or apricots in the middle of the winter are bad habits and should not even be considered, as they just do not
        respect nature.
        These choices should be made for obvious ecological reasons, but other challenges are also at the core of this
        need to consume more locally.
        Indeed, the agricultural sector in Switzerland suffers from a decreasing employement rate since 1990, evolving
        from more than 250'000
        employees in the country to a little more than 150'000 in 2016 (<a
                href="https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/05_Publikationen/SES/SES_2016-93.pdf">
            statistics from Union suisse des Paysans, archives from 2016</a>). The agricultural sector could be the
        first
        to benefit from a consumption of
        local products and such behavior, if generalized to a great amount of the population, could save small farmers
        and help the swiss economy.<br><br>
        As a conclusion to this observable trend, it is interesting to acknowledge that beyond the general visible
        tendency of promoting regional products in our
        supermarkets, the question risen by this study is in fact more important and significant that one might think.
        Indeed, in 2014, the SSN, the Société Suisse de Nutrition
        (the Swiss Society for Nutrition), created a programm called <a
                href="http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fr/toi-et-moi/boire-et-manger/equilibre-alimentaire/foodprints/">
            FOODprints</a>, which encourage people to consume more locally. The group found out that 25% of our
        environmental nuisances are due to our
        bad eating habits which include, among other components, such as our too large consumption of meat, the fact
        that we tend to buy too many
        products that are not seasonal or that were imported by plane. Of course, Switzerland have to import products in
        order to feed its population,
        as the land resources are not sufficient for the entire country (<a
                href="http://www.sge-ssn.ch/media/reportage_4_2010.pdf">as reported from SSN</a>).
        But, by consuming products according to their season in our latitude, we can reduce the ecological impact, as
        they will require shorter
        journeys to be imported, and we can also increase our nutritional health, by beeing aware of what we eat and
        why.
        The question of the consumption of local products is thus linked to the complex issues of our health, that
        greatly depends on our environment,
        hence the ecological aspect, and on our bad alimentary habits, and to the importance of developing and promoting
        local workers,
        which is also related to an economic aspect.
