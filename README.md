# Abstract
At an era where more and more ecological questions are risen, it seems that European countries, such as Switzerland or France, are trying to encourage the sale of their national products within their own territory and reduce the importation of alimentary goods. Indeed, one can easily notice that swiss supermarkets are promoting regional products, with labels such as “Aus der Region”, whereas our French neighbors are developing new advertisement campaigns with labels, such as “Nos regions ont du talent” or “Reflets de France” in order to answer a growing request from customers to buy local products. However, are these few changes a simple superficial trend, or do we really import less goods? The research thus intends to determine the origin of most products we consume within Europe and beyond and understand the amount of exchanges of resources that is globally practiced, from the origin of the ingredients, the place of manufacture and the countries a product is sold in. The research will be conducted with the help of the data base Open Food Facts https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data, which provides origin information about products that are consumed in different countries around the world.


# Research questions
-Where are the products we consume in our everydaylife coming from?
-Which country has the monopole of exportation in Europe and worldwide?
-Which country depends the most on importation of products?
-Which country produces the most primary resources (ground ingredients)?
-Which country manufacture most products?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

- Open Food Facts https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data :
The database is composed of alimentary products thare consumed around the world. Each product contains a list of ingredients, their origin, the country or places where the product is manufactured or transformed and the countries where the product is sold. The goal would be to use this information and create an interactive map showing the exchanges occuring between countries in term of alimentary goods.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
-We should determine the list of products that are sold in each country.
-We should then classify these products under different categories:
    *products entirely originating from the country it is sold in
    *products partially originating from the country (manufactured in the country but ingredients are from another country)
    *products not originating from the country it is sold in
- For each country, a statistic showing the amound of import and export could then be built
- It would be then possible to determine bigger exportator of primary ressources and/or manufactured products. A link to major manufactor brands can also be made.
- Create an (interactive) map showing these exchange
- Create a map showing major actors on the global food market
