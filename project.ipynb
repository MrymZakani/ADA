    "2. Is there a trend over time to consume more local products?\n",

    "    - Are new products mostly using primary resources from Switzerland? Or from other countries inside Europe?\n",
    "    - Are new products mostly manufactured in Switzerland? Or from other countries inside Europe?\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Cleaning/Exploring dataset\n",
    "   - Descriptive analysis\n",
    "   - We should determine the list of products that are sold in Switzerland\n",
    "   - We should then classify these products under different categories:\n",
    "        - products entirely originating from Switzerland\n",
    "        - products partially originating from Switzerland (manufactured in Switzerland but ingredients are from another country)\n",
    "        - products not originating from Switzerland\n",
    "   - Draw statistics from the importation balances, determining which are the countries producing most of the ground ingredients and manufacturing the products consumed in Switzerland.\n"
